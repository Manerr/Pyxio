# Pyxio is:
### A 13kb fitting, not-finished and **retro** looking **HTML5** **game**

#### Since it's not finished, it's not really playable (but veryting works, note that!).

### Features:

- [x] Running
- [x] Responsive
- [x] Retro looking ( 64*64 pixels ) , thus lightweight -> it weights less than 13kb 
- [ ] Has a gameplay
- [ ] Multiple levels
- [ ] Soundtrack -> it'd be really hard to add a soundtrack from a casual audio file -> I'm currently working on webaudio based sound engine that'll, maybe a day, be alive.
